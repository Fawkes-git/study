abstract = {Objective: To quantify uni- and bimanual upper-limb use in patients with chronic stroke in daily life compared with healthy controls. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients with chronic stroke (n=38) and healthy controls (n=18). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Upper-limb use in daily life was measured with an accelerometry-based upper-limb activity monitor, an accelerometer based measurement device. Unimanual use of the paretic and the nonparetic side and bimanual upper-limb use were measured for a period of 24 hours. Outcomes were expressed in terms of both duration and intensity. Results: Patients used their unaffected limb much more than their affected limb (5.3h vs 2.4h), while controls used both limbs a more equal amount of time (5.4h vs 5.1h). Patients used their paretic side less than controls used their nondominant side and their nonparetic side more than controls their dominant side. The intensity with which patients used their paretic side was lower than that with which controls used their nondominant side, while that of the nonparetic side was higher than that of the dominant side of controls. Finally, patients used their paretic side almost exclusively in bimanual activities. During bimanual activities, the intensity with which they used their affected side was much lower than that of the nonaffected side. Conclusion: Our data show considerable nonuse of the paretic side, both in duration and in intensity, and both during unimanual and bimanual activities in patients with chronic stroke. Patients do compensate for this with increased use of the nonparetic side. ?? 2012 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Objective: To study the validity of accelerometry in the assessment of arm activity of patients with impaired arm function after stroke. Design: Cross-sectional concurrent validity study. Setting: Rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients (N=45) at different stages after stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: All patients wore 2 triaxial accelerometers around their wrists during 3 consecutive days. Arm activity was assessed, based on unilateral (activity of the affected arm) and bilateral accelerometry (ratio between the activity of the affected and nonaffected arm). The Motor Activity Log-26 (MAL-26) Amount of Use (AOU) scale was used as the main external criterion to test the concurrent validity of arm accelerometry. In addition, the MAL-26 Quality of Movement (QOM) scale and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) subscale Hand Function were used. To test the divergent validity, the SIS subscale Mobility was used. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. In an additional regression analysis, the hypothesized confounding influence of spasm, therapy intensity, and interobserver differences was studied. Results: Both unilateral (??=.58, P{\textless}.001) and bilateral (??=.60, P{\textless}.001) accelerometry were significantly related to the MAL-AOU scale. Associations of both unilateral and bilateral accelerometry with the MAL-QOM and SIS subscale Hand Function corroborated these findings. The SIS subscale Mobility was not significantly associated with unilateral accelerometry (??=.41, P=.01) or bilateral accelerometry (??=.23, P=.11). None of the hypothesized confounders influenced these associations significantly. Conclusions: Based on the results, both the concurrent and divergent validity of unilateral and bilateral arm accelerometry for measuring arm activity after stroke are good. ?? 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. We propose a novel simple method for quantitative and qualitative finger-tapping assessment based on miniature inertial sensors (3D gyroscopes) placed on the thumb and index-finger. We propose a simplified description of the finger tapping by using a single angle, describing rotation around a dominant axis. The method was verified on twelve subjects, who performed various tapping tasks, mimicking impaired patterns. The obtained tapping angles were compared with results of a motion capture camera system, demonstrating excellent accuracy. The root-mean-square (RMS) error between the two sets of data is, on average, below 4 ◦ , and the intraclass correlation coefficient is, on average, greater than 0.972. Data obtained by the proposed method may be used together with scores from clinical tests to enable a better diagnostic. Along with hardware simplicity, this makes the proposed method a promising candidate for use in clinical practice. Furthermore, our definition of the tapping angle can be applied to all tapping assessment systems.},

@article{Hayward2016,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ultimate goal of upper-limb rehabilitation after stroke is to promote real-world use, that is, use of the paretic upper-limb in everyday activities outside the clinic or laboratory. Although real-world use can be collected through self-report questionnaires, an objective indicator is preferred. Accelerometers are a promising tool. The current paper aims to explore the feasibility of accelerometers to measure upper-limb use after stroke and discuss the translation of this measurement tool into clinical practice. Accelerometers are non-invasive, wearable sensors that measure movement in arbitrary units called activity counts. Research to date indicates that activity counts are a reliable and valid index of upper-limb use. While most accelerometers are unable to distinguish between the type and quality of movements performed, recent advancements have used accelerometry data to produce clinically meaningful information for clinicians, patients, family and care givers. Despite this, widespread uptake in research and clinical environments remains limited. If uptake was enhanced, we could build a deeper understanding of how people with stroke use their arm in real-world environments. In order to facilitate greater uptake, however, there is a need for greater consistency in protocol development, accelerometer application and data interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The device consists of an infrared proximity sensor for measuring finger flexion and a 1-axis gyroscope for measuring finger rotation. Notably, LightRing tracks subtle fingertip movements from the finger base without requiring instrumentation of other body parts or the environment. This keeps the normal hand function intact and allows for a socially acceptable appearance. We evaluate LightRing in a 2d pointing experiment in two scenarios: on a desk while sitting down, and on the leg while standing. Our results indicate that the device has potential to enable a variety of rich mobile input scenarios. Author},

With regard to the rehabilitation of patients who have suffered from traumas, robotic systems can be an aid for rapid patient recovery. This paper focuses on studying and implementing a system for measuring the finger position of one hand with the aim of giving feedback to the rehabilitation system. It consists of a glove where sensors are mounted suitably configured and connected to an electronic conditioning and acquisition unit. The information regarding the position is then sent to a remote system. The objective of this paper is to provide a sensorized glove for monitoring the rehabilitation activities of the hand. The glove can have several other applications such as: 1) the recognition of sign language; 2) the diagnostic measurement of the finger movement at a distance; and 3) the interaction with virtual reality.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop and evaluate a system for the objective measurement of upper-limb activity during a person's activities of daily living. Design: Construct validation study. Setting: Home and work environment. Participants: Ten able-bodied participants and 10 stroke patients. Interventions: A novel activity monitor was developed for monitoring upper-limb activity. The Strathclyde Upper-Limb Activity Monitor (SULAM) gave a signal proportional to the vertical displacement of the wrist with respect to the shoulder. Participants wore the SULAM on both upper limbs for 8 hours while performing their normal daily activities. Main Outcome Measures: SULAM-derived variables quantified the total upper-limb activity and the range in which movement of the upper limb occurred. Results: Data showed that the dominant arm of the able-bodied participants was 19{\%} more active than the nondominant arm, whereas the unaffected arms of the group of stroke patients was used 3 to 6 times more than their affected arm. For all the variables, in both groups, there were significant differences between their upper limbs except for movement below midtrunk. There were also significant differences between groups for bimanual movement time (P=.000) and composite movement time (P=.000). Conclusions: The results suggest that the quantification of vertical position of the wrist with respect to the shoulder might reflect upper-limb activity. By using the SULAM, it is possible to monitor upper-limb activity over the course of a person's normal day, with minimal interference. This study provides preliminary evidence of the SULAM as a useful tool for objectively evaluating interventions aimed at improving upper-limb activity and function. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a semistructured interview for hemiparetic stroke patients to assess the use of their paretic arm and hand (amount of use [AOU]) and quality of movement [QOM]) during activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 to 5. The following clinimetric properties of the MAL were quantified: internal consistency (Cronbach alpha), test-retest agreement (Bland and Altman method), cross-sectional construct validity (correlation between AOU and QOM and with the Action Research Arm [ARA] test), longitudinal construct validity (correlation of change on the MAL during the intervention with a global change rating [GCR] and with change on the ARA), and responsiveness (effect size). METHODS: Two baseline measurements 2 weeks apart and 1 follow-up measurement immediately after 2 weeks of intensive exercise therapy either with or without immobilization of the unimpaired arm (forced use) were performed in 56 chronic stroke patients. RESULTS: Internal consistency was high (AOU: alpha=0.88; QOM: alpha=0.91). The limits of agreement were -0.70 to 0.85 and -0.61 to 0.71 for AOU and QOM, respectively. The correlation with the ARA score (Spearman rho) was 0.63 (AOU and QOM). However, the improvement on the MAL during the intervention was only weakly related to the GCR and to the improvement on the ARA, Spearman rho was between 0.16 and 0.22. The responsiveness ratio was 1.9 (AOU) and 2.0 (QOM). CONCLUSIONS: The MAL is internally consistent and relatively stable in chronic stroke patients not undergoing an intervention. The cross-sectional construct validity of the MAL is reasonable, but the results raise doubt about its longitudinal construct validity.},

The glove is devoted to the continuous monitoring of patients during their daily life activities, in particular for stroke survivors during their rehabilitation. The prototype performances have been evaluated in comparison with an optical tracking system considered as a gold standard both for relieving static and dynamic posture and gesture of the hand. The introduced prototype has shown very interesting figures of merit. The angular error, evaluated through the standard Bland Altman analysis, has been estimated in 3 which is slightly less accurate than commercial electro-goniometers. Moreover, a new conceptual prototype design, preliminary evaluated within this work, is presented and discussed in order to solve actual limitations in terms of number and type of sensor connections, avoiding mechanical constraints given by metallic inextensible wires and improving user comfort.},

Correlation between the motor scales was very high (rho {\textgreater} 0.92). Motor scales correlated moderately highly with the Hemispheric Stroke Scale, a measure of impairment (rho = 0.660-0.689), but not with the Modified Barthel Index, a measure of the ability to cope with basic activities of daily living (rho = 0.044-0.086). Conclusions: The standardized guidelines assured comparability of test administration and scoring across clinical facilities.

abstract = {This article describes the study design, methodological considerations, and demographic characteristics of a phase III RCT to determine if 1) constraint-induced therapy (CI therapy) can be applied with therapeutic success 3 to 9 months after stroke across different sites, 2) gains that might occur persist over 2 years, 3) initial level of motor ability determines responsiveness to CI therapy, and 4) the treatment effect differs between those treated before 9 months and after 1 year. Six sites will screen and recruit poststroke survivors stratified on initial level of motor ability and after randomization allocate participants to immediate or delayed intervention. Primary outcomes include a laboratory-based measure of function (Wolf Motor Function Test [WMFT]) and a real-world participant-centered functional use measure (Motor Activity Log [MAI]). Secondary outcomes concern function, behavior, and compliance. This is the first multisite, single-blind RCT of a formal training intervention for upper extremity rehabilitation in subacute stroke in the United States.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for vision based estimation of the pose of human hands in interaction with objects. Despite the fact that most robotics applications of human hand tracking involve grasping and manipulation of objects, the majority of methods in the literature assume a free hand, isolated from the surrounding environment. Our hand tracking method is non-parametric, performing a nearest neighbor search in a large database (100000 entries) of hand poses with and without grasped objects. The system operates in real time, it is robust to self occlusions, object occlusions and segmentation errors, and provides full hand pose reconstruction from markerless video. Temporal consistency in hand pose is taken into account, without explicitly tracking the hand in the high dimensional pose space.},

Various data gloves have been developed for rehabilitation and manual dexterity assessments. This study proposed a modular data glove with 9-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs) to obtain static and dynamic parameters during hand function evaluation. A sensor fusion algorithm is used to calculate the range of motion of joints. The data glove is designed to have low cost, easy wearability, and high reliability. Owing to the modular design, the IMU board is independent and extensible and can be used with various microcontrollers to realize more medical applications. This design greatly enhances the stability and maintainability of the glove.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method to quantitatively measure and evaluate finger tapping movements for the assessment of motor function using log-linearized Gaussian mixture networks (LLGMNs). First, finger tapping movements are measured using magnetic sensors, and eleven indices are computed for evaluation. After standardizing these indices based on those of normal subjects, they are input to LLGMNs to assess motor function. Then, motor ability is probabilistically discriminated to determine whether it is normal or not using a classifier combined with the output of multiple LLGMNs based on bagging and entropy. This paper reports on evaluation and discrimination experiments performed on finger tapping movements in 33 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 32 normal elderly subjects. The results showed that the patients could be classified correctly in terms of their impairment status with a high degree of accuracy (average rate: 93:1 {\S} 3:69{\%}) using 12 LLGMNs, which was about 5{\%} higher than the results obtained using a single LLGMN.},

To determine the validity of the DG, the investigators measured 8 randomly selected, computer-aided design (CAD) angles during each of the 3 data collection sessions. Physical therapist participants completed pre-/post-surveys to assess perceptions of clinical usability of the DG.No statistically significant differences were found between devices. Comparison of the DG and UG demonstrated no difference for intra- or inter-rater reliability, with the DG yielding higher inter-rater ICC values for each of the 5 motions measured.The DG has adequate concurrent criterion-related validity as a tool for assessment of joint ROM and equivalent inter- and intra-rater reliability to the UG. User surveys indicated that several of the novel features of the DG contributed to a higher likelihood that the device would be utilized by clinicians.},

The system consists of four modules: a real time hand tracking and extraction, feature extraction, hidden Markov model (HMM) training, and gesture recognition. First, we apply a real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm to trace the moving hand and extract the hand region, then we use the Fourier descriptor (FD) to characterize spatial features and the motion analysis to characterize the temporal features. We combine the spatial and temporal features of the input image sequence as our feature vector. After having extracted the feature vectors, we apply HMMs to recognize the input gesture. The gesture to be recognized is separately scored against different HMMs. The model with the highest score indicates the corresponding gesture. In the experiments, we have tested our system to recognize 20 different gestures, and the recognizing rate is above 90{\%}.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In research on Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy, a structured interview, the Motor Activity Log (MAL), is used to assess how stroke survivors use their more-impaired arm outside the laboratory. This article examines the psychometrics of the 14-item version of this instrument in 2 chronic stroke samples with mild-to-moderate upper-extremity hemiparesis. METHODS: Participants (n=41) in the first study completed MALs before and after CI therapy or a placebo control procedure. In addition, caregivers independently completed a MAL on the participants. Participants (n=27) in the second study completed MALs and wore accelerometers that monitored their arm movements for 3 days outside the laboratory before and after an automated form of CI therapy. RESULTS: Validity of the participant MAL Quality of Movement (QOM) scale was supported. Correlations between pretreatment-to-posttreatment change scores on the participant QOM scale and caregiver MAL QOM scale, caregiver MAL amount of use (AOU) scale, and accelerometer recordings were 0.70, 0.73, and 0.91 (P{\textless}0.01), respectively. Internal consistency (alpha{\textgreater}0.81), test-retest reliability (r{\textgreater}0.91), stability, and responsiveness (ratio{\textgreater}3) of the participant QOM scale were also supported. The participant AOU and caregiver QOM and AOU scales were internally consistent, stable, and sensitive, but were not reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The participant MAL QOM scale can be used exclusively to reliably and validly measure real-world, upper-extremity rehabilitation outcome and functional status in chronic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis.},

abstract = {We describe rapid massive endocytosis (MEND) of {\textgreater}50{\%} of the plasmalemma in baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK293 cells in response to large Ca transients. Constitutively expressed Na/Ca exchangers (NCX1) are used to generate Ca transients, whereas capacitance recording and a membrane tracer dye, FM 4-64, are used to monitor endocytosis. With high cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate (ATP; {\textgreater} 5 mM), Ca influx causes exocytosis followed by MEND. Without ATP, Ca transients cause only exocytosis. MEND can then be initiated by pipette perfusion of ATP, and multiple results indicate that ATP acts via phosphatidylinositol-bis 4,5-phosphate (PIP2) synthesis: PIP2 substitutes for ATP to induce MEND. ATP-activated MEND is blocked by an inositol 5-phosphatase and by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio] triphosphate (GTP gamma S). Block by GTP gamma S is overcome by the phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, and PIP2 induces MEND in the presence of GTP gamma S. MEND can occur in the absence of ATP and PIP2 when cytoplasmic free Ca is clamped to 10 mu M or more by Ca-buffered solutions. ATP-independent MEND occurs within seconds during Ca transients when cytoplasmic solutions contain polyamines (e. g., spermidine) or the membrane is enriched in cholesterol. Although PIP2 and cholesterol can induce MEND minutes after Ca transients have subsided, polyamines must be present during Ca transients. MEND can reverse over minutes in an ATP-dependent fashion. It is blocked by brief beta-methylcyclodextrin treatments, and tests for involvement of clathrin, dynamins, calcineurin, and actin cytoskeleton were negative. Therefore, we turned to the roles of lipids. Bacterial sphingomyelinases (SMases) cause similar MEND responses within seconds, suggesting that ceramide may be important. However, Ca-activated MEND is not blocked by reagents that inhibit SMases. MEND is abolished by the alkylating phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, whereas exocytosis remains robust, and Ca influx causes MEND in cardiac myocytes without preceding exocytosis. Thus, exocytosis is not prerequisite for MEND. From these results and two companion studies, we suggest that Ca promotes the formation of membrane domains that spontaneously vesiculate to the cytoplasmic side.},

We randomized 59 patients with stroke into one of three rehabilitation treatments for 3 weeks. We administered six outcome measures (BBT, NHPT, ARAT, Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA], Motor Activity Log [MAL], and Stroke Impact Scale [SIS] hand function domain) pretreatment and posttreatment. We used the standardized response mean (SRM) to examine responsiveness and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) to examine concurrent validity. The BBT, NHPT, and ARAT were moderately responsive to change and not significantly different (SRM = 0.64-0.79). The correlations within the BBT, NHPT, and ARAT were moderate to good at pretreatment (rho = -0.55 to -0.80) and posttreatment (rho = -0.57 to -0.71). The BBT and ARAT showed fair to moderate correlations with the FMA, MAL, and SIS hand function domain at pretreatment and posttreatment (rho = 0.31-0.59), whereas the NHPT demonstrated low to fair correlations with the FMA and MAL (rho = -0.16 to -0.33) and moderate correlations with the SIS hand function domain (rho = -0.58 to -0.66). Our results indicate that the BBT, NHPT, and ARAT are suitable to detect changes over time. While simultaneously considering the responsiveness and validity attributes, the BBT and ARAT can be considered more appropriate for evaluating dexterous function than the NHPT. Further studies with larger samples are needed to validate these findings.},

The therapy becomes less effective and less efficient since each therapist must handle too many patients during his/her work hours. This research has developed a device prototype that can help the therapy to measure and monitor patient exercise, especially at the final stage of rehabilitation when the patient gets therapy to move actively. The angle of the moving body parts  that can represent the ability of patient motion was measured using accelerometers. The developed prototype was in the form of a glove, equipped with an Arduino Nano and two accelerometer modules, that measures the motion of the thumb and index finger. The device was calibrated and tested to determine the characteristics of the sensors. This test showed that the gloves prototype had an accuracy of 95,8{\%} and precision of 99,6{\%}. The application of the prototype was carried out on four types of finger movements, namely thumb abduction-adduction, thumb flexion-extension, finger flexion-hyperextension, and finger abduction-adduction.

By utilizing three ¿four-bar mechanism joint¿ in series and wire coupling mechanism, the master finger transmission ratio is kept exact 1:1.4:1 in the whole movement range and it can make active motions in both extension and flexion direction. Additionally, to assure faster data transmission and near zero delay in master-slave operation, a digital signal processing/field programmable gate array (DSP/FPGA-FPGA) structure with 200 ¿s cycle time is designed. The operating modes of the master hand can be contact or non-contact, which depends on the motion states of slave hand, free motion or constrained motion. The position control employed in non-contact mode ensures unconstrained motion and the force control adopted in contact mode guarantees natural contact sensation. To evaluate the performances of the master hand, an master-slave control experiment based on force-position control method between the master hand and DLR/HIT hand is conducted. The results demonstrate this new type master hand can augment telepresence.},

abstract = {Impaired manual dexterity is a frequently reported disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly prevalent with worsening disease. While various tests and patient-reported outcome measures are available, the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) is considered as a gold standard measure of manual dexterity and most frequently used in MS research and clinical practice. The MS Outcome Assessments Consortium (MSOAC) includes representatives from advocacy organizations, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), academic institutions, and industry partners along with persons living with MS. Among the MSOAC goals are acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful to persons with MS. A critical step for these neuroperformance metrics is elucidation of clinically relevant benchmarks, well-defined degrees of disability, and gradients of change that are deemed clinically meaningful. This article addresses the NHPT, the proposed MSOAC measure for upper extremity function. We find that the NHPT is reliable within and between test sessions, discriminates between healthy subjects and MS patients with different levels of upper limb impairment, and shows high convergent validity with other manual dexterity as well as more comprehensive upper limb measures. Ecological validity is established by its relation to perceived upper limb use in daily life and perceived difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The NHPT is responsive to deterioration in longitudinal studies, and research suggests that a 20{\%} change in test score is commonly used to define clinically meaningful worsening, a definition that needs further validation in all stages of the disease.},

abstract = {Of various Human-Computer-Interactions (HCI), hand gesture based HCI might be the most natural and intuitive way to communicate between people and machines, since it closely mimics how human interact with each other. Its in- tuitiveness and naturalness have spawned many applications in exploring large and complex data, computer games, virtual reality, health care, etc. Although the market for hand gesture based HCI is huge, building a robust hand gesture recognition system remains a challenging problem for traditional vision-based approaches, which are greatly limited by the quality of the input from optical sensors. [16] proposed a novel dissimilarity distance metric for hand gesture recognition using Kinect sensor, called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD). In this paper, we compare the performance in terms of speed and accuracy between FEMD and traditional corresponding- based shape matching algorithm, Shape Context. And then we introduce several HCI applications built on top of a accurate and robust hand gesture recognition system based on FEMD. This hand gesture recognition system performs robustly despite variations in hand orientation, scale or articulation. Moreover, it works well in uncontrolled environments with background clus- ters. We demonstrate that this robust hand gesture recognition system can be a key enabler for numerous hand gesture based HCI systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, a wearable sensing glove for measuring the motion of the fingers is proposed. The system consists of linear potentiometers, flexible wires, and linear springs, which makes it compact and lightweight so that it does not interfere with the natural motion of the fingers. Inspired by the way wrinkles on finger joints are smoothed out when the finger is flexed, a flexible wire is attached to the back of each finger. As the flexible wire moves due to the motion of the finger, the joint angles are calculated by measuring the change in length of wire. Linear potentiometers with linear springs were used to maintain the tension of the wires in order to measure the wire length change consistently. Because the motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is dependent on that of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, only two linear potentiometers were used for each finger. A compact sensing module including 10 linear potentiometers and springs was attached to a glove. The proposed system can widely be applied for the systems, which require to measure finger motions accurately, e.g., virtual reality or teleoperation systems. Such feasible applications were actually implemented and introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {A key reason for referral to rehabilitation services after stroke and other neurological conditions is to improve one's ability to function in daily life. It has become important to measure a person's activities in daily life, and not just measure their capacity for activity in the structured environment of a clinic or laboratory. A wearable sensor that is now enabling measurement of daily movement is the accelerometer. Accelerometers are commercially-available devices resembling large wrist watches that can be worn throughout the day. Data from accelerometers can quantify how the limbs are engaged to perform activities in peoples' homes and communities. This report describes a methodology to collect accelerometry data and turn it into clinically-relevant information. First, data are collected by having the participant wear two accelerometers (one on each wrist) for 24 h or longer. The accelerometry data are then downloaded and processed to produce four different variables that describe key aspects of upper limb activity in daily life: hours of use, use ratio, magnitude ratio, and the bilateral magnitude. Density plots can be constructed that visually represent the data from the 24 h wearing period. The variables and their resultant density plots are highly consistent in neurologically-intact, community-dwelling adults. This striking consistency makes them a useful tool for determining if upper limb daily performance is different from normal. This methodology is appropriate for research studies investigating upper limb dysfunction and interventions designed to improve upper limb performance in daily life in people with stroke and other patient populations. Because of its relative simplicity, it may not be long before it is also incorporated in clinical neurorehabilitation practice.},

First, common UE impairments and how to assess them are briefly discussed. Although multiple UE impairments are typically present after stroke, the severity of one's impairment, paresis, is the primary determinant of UE functional loss. Second, UE function is operationally defined and a number of clinical measures are discussed. It is important to consider how impairment and loss of function affect UE activity outside of the clinical environment. Thus, this review also identifies accelerometry as an objective method for assessing UE activity in daily life. Finally, the role that each of these levels of assessment should play in clinical decision making is discussed to optimize the provision of stroke rehabilitation services. ?? 2013 Hanley {\&} Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ultimate goal of upper-limb rehabilitation after stroke is to promote real-world use, that is, use of the paretic upper-limb in everyday activities outside the clinic or laboratory. Although real-world use can be collected through self-report questionnaires, an objective indicator is preferred. Accelerometers are a promising tool. The current paper aims to explore the feasibility of accelerometers to measure upper-limb use after stroke and discuss the translation of this measurement tool into clinical practice. Accelerometers are non-invasive, wearable sensors that measure movement in arbitrary units called activity counts. Research to date indicates that activity counts are a reliable and valid index of upper-limb use. While most accelerometers are unable to distinguish between the type and quality of movements performed, recent advancements have used accelerometry data to produce clinically meaningful information for clinicians, patients, family and care givers. Despite this, widespread uptake in research and clinical environments remains limited. If uptake was enhanced, we could build a deeper understanding of how people with stroke use their arm in real-world environments. In order to facilitate greater uptake, however, there is a need for greater consistency in protocol development, accelerometer application and data interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Inhibitors of farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) show promise as anticancer agents. Based on the sequence of the protein substrates of FPTase (the CAAX sequence), potent and selective peptidomimetic inhibitors have been developed; these compounds share with the peptide substrate a free thiol and a C-terminal carboxylate. We have used a synthetic tetrapeptide combinatorial library to screen for new leads devoid of these features: the peptides were C-terminally amidated, and no free thiol was included in the combinatorial building blocks. To compensate for this negative bias, an expanded set of 68 amino acids was used, including both L and D as well as many non-coded residues. Sixteen individual tetrapeptides derived from the consensus were synthesized and tested; all were active, showing IC50 values ranging from low micromolar to low nanomolar. The most active peptide, D-tryptophan-D-methionine-D-4-chlorophenylalanine-L-gamma- carboxyglutamic acid (Ki = 2 nM), is also very selective showing little inhibitory activity against the related enzyme geranylgeranyl-protein transferase type I (IC50 {\textgreater} 50 microM). In contrast to CAAX-based peptidomimetics, D-tryptophan-D-methionine-D-4-chlorophenylalanine-L-gamma-carboxyglut amic acid appeared to mimic the isoprenoid substrate farnesyl diphosphate as determined by kinetic and physical measurements. D-Tryptophan-Dmethionine-D-4-chlorophenylalanine-L-gamma- carboxyglutamic acid was a competitive inhibitor of FPTase with respect to farnesyl diphosphate substrate and uncompetitive with respect to CAAX substrate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FPTase undergoes ligand dependent conformational changes in its circular dichroism spectrum and that D-tryptophan-D-methionine-D-4-chlorophenylalanine-L-gamma- carboxyglutamic acid induced a conformational change identical to that observed with farnesyl diphosphate ligand.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate clinical assessment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is challenging. The Assess MS system is being developed to automatically quantify motor dysfunction in MS, including upper extremity function (UEF) and mobility. OBJECTIVE: To determine to what extent combinations of standardized movements included in the Assess MS system explain accepted measures of UEF and mobility. METHODS: MS patients were recruited at four European MS centres. Eight movements were selected, including tasks of activities of daily living (ADL) and classical neurological tests. Movements were recorded on video and rated by experienced neurologists ( n = 5). Subsequently, multivariate linear regression models were performed to explain the variance of the Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Arm Function in Multiple Sclerosis Questionnaire (AMSQ) and Timed-25 Foot Walk test (T25WT). RESULTS: In total, 257 patients were included. The movements explained 62.9{\%} to 80.1{\%} of the variance of the 9HPT models, 43.3{\%} and 44.3{\%} of the AMSQ models and 70.8{\%} of the T25WT. In all models, tasks of ADL contributed most to the variance. CONCLUSION: Combinations of movements are valuable to assess UEF and mobility. Incorporating ADL tasks into daily clinical practice and clinical trials may be more valuable than the classical neurological examination of UEF and mobility.},

abstract = {Angular measurements of knee joint are a key factor in orthoses design, actually is very important for human gait analysis in order to obtain a deep knowledge of the musculoskeletal system performance. Video-based motion analysis systems have been used as measurement tools to quantify the angle and movement of knee joint. Though this technique is good, it requires special equipment and high computational cost. This work introduces a novel method of knee joint measurement. The design is mainly based on the contactless magnetic absolute encoder AS5040 (Austria Microsystems{\textregistered}, USA), and the microprocessor type PIC16F877A. The developed device has a resolution of 0.35 degrees, quite enough for an orthosis that requires knee position measurements. The reliability of the system was evaluated by making: 1) Static measurements by using a mechanical goniometer as reference, in which a correlation up to 0.999 was obtained. 2) Dynamical measurements by performing flexion-extension movements by a healthy subject and comparing the records with a commercial motion analysis system (APAS{\textregistered}, USA). A correlation of 0.9943 was obtained. Besides, trials were performed by three subjects under natural gait.},

It builds on the social science critique of bioethics present in the work of authors such as Ren{\'{e}}e Fox, Barry Hoffmaster and Charles Bosk, proposing the characteristics of a critical bioethics that would take social science seriously. The social science critique claims that traditional philosophical bioethics gives a dominant role to idealised, rational thought, and tends to exclude social and cultural factors, relegating them to the status of irrelevancies. Another problem is the way in which bioethics assumes social reality divides down the same lines/categories as philosophical theories. Critical bioethics requires bioethicists to root their enquires in empirical research, to challenge theories using evidence, to be reflexive and to be sceptical about the claims of other bioethicists, scientists and clinicians.

abstract = {The assessment of repetitive tasks (ART) tool is designed to help you risk assess tasks that require repetitive moving of the upper limbs (arms and hands). It helps you to assess some of the common risk factors in repetitive work that contribute to the development of upper limb disorders (ULDs). ART is aimed at those responsible for designing, assessing, managing and inspecting repetitive work. It can help identify those tasks that involve significant risks and where to focus risk-reduction measures. It will be useful to employers, safety representatives, health and safety practitioners, consultants and ergonomists. Further information on ART, including online training on how to use the tool, can be found at www.hse.gov.uk/msd/uld/art. Repetitive tasks are made up of a sequence of upper limb actions, of fairly short duration, which are repeated over and over again, and are almost always the same (eg stitching a piece of cloth, manufacturing one part, packaging one item).  ART is most suited for tasks that:  involve actions of the upper limbs;  repeat every few minutes, or even more frequently; and  occur for at least 1–2 hours per day or shift.  The tasks are typically found in assembly, production, processing, packaging, packing and sorting work, as well as work involving the regular use of hand tools.  ART is not intended for display screen equipment (DSE) assessments. ART is made up of three sections:  The assessment guide – this provides detailed information about how to use the tool, the risk factors and the assessment criteria. Read it carefully before using the tool.  The flow chart – this provides an overview of the assessment process. It also guides experienced users through the tool fairly quickly.  The task description form and score sheet – this provides a place to record information about the task as well as the findings of the assessment. Before completing ART  Spend some time observing the task to ensure that what you are seeing is representative of normal practices.  It is important to consult workers and safety representatives during the assessment process.  Where several people do the same task, make sure you consult more than one worker about the demands of the task.  It may help to video record the task so you can view it again, away from the work area.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The consensus is that the most important outcome for rehabilitation is functional activity in the life situation. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, a new treatment that transfers in-clinic gains to the life situation, demands objective measurement of real-world movement. However, direct, objective, and accurate measures of arm use in the real world are not available. Previous attempts to use accelerometry to measure extremity movement have failed because of unacceptable variability. This problem has been addressed here by use of a threshold filter. METHODS: Nine stroke patients and 1 healthy individual wearing accelerometers were videotaped while they carried out their usual activities at home or in the clinic; the duration of their arm, torso, and ambulatory movements was judged by 2 observation teams. In addition, 11 college students performed 5 standardized activities of daily living for varying durations in the laboratory. The accelerometer data were transformed; the raw value recorded for a given epoch was set to a constant if it exceeded a low threshold. RESULTS: The threshold-filtered recordings measured the duration of movement accurately and with very little variability. Correlations between the threshold-filtered recordings and the observer ratings of the duration of arm, torso, and ambulatory movements were 0.93, 0.93 and 0.99, respectively; the corresponding correlations for the raw values were -0.17, 0.34, and 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: These results present initial evidence for the validity of threshold-filtered accelerometer recordings for objectively measuring the amount of real-world upper-extremity movement as an index of treatment outcome for rehabilitation patients.},

@article{Taub2006,
abstract = {Research on monkeys with a single forelimb from which sensation is surgically abolished demonstrates that such animals do not use their deafferented limb even though they possess sufficient motor innervation to do so, a phenomenon labeled learned nonuse. This dissociation also occurs after neurological injury in humans. Instruments that measure these two aspects of motor function are discussed. The effects of a neurological injury may differ widely in regard to motor ability assessed on a laboratory performance test in which movements are requested and actual spontaneous use of an extremity in real-world settings, indicating that these parameters need to be evaluated separately. The methods used in Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) research to independently assess these two domains are reliable and valid. We suggest that these tests have applicability beyond studies involving CI therapy for stroke and may be of value for determining motor status in other types of motor disorders and with other types of treatment. The learned nonuse formulation also predicts that a rehabilitation treatment may have differential effects on motor performance made on request and actual spontaneous amount of use of a more affected upper extremity in the life situation. CI therapy produces improvements in the former, but focuses attention on the latter and, in fact, spontaneous use of the limb is where this intervention has by far its greatest effect. The evidence suggests that this result is driven by use of a ''transfer package'' of techniques, which can be used with other therapies to increase the transfer of improvements made in the clinic to the life situation. The use of CI therapy in humans began with the upper extremity after stroke and was then extended for the upper extremity to cerebral palsy in young children (8 months to 8 years old) and traumatic brain injury. A form of CI therapy was developed for the lower extremities and was used effectively after stroke, spinal cord injury, and fractured hip. Adaptations of CI therapy have also been developed for aphasia (CI aphasia therapy), focal hand dystonia in musicians and phantom limb pain. The range of these applications suggests that CI therapy is not only a treatment for stroke, for which it is most commonly used, but for learned nonuse in general, which manifests as excess motor disability in a number of conditions which until now have been refractory to treatment.},

The paper also compares these properties in several commonly used single-site accelerometers. The emerging accelerometry technologies introduced include the multisensor arrays and the combination of accelerometers with physiological sensors. The outputs of accelerometers are compared with criterion measures of energy expenditure (indirect calorimeters and double-labeled water) to develop mathematical models (linear, nonlinear, and variability approaches)., Results: The technologies of the sensor and data processing directly influence the results of the outcome measurement (activity counts and energy expenditure predictions). Multisite assessment and combining accelerometers with physiological measures may offer additional advantages. Nonlinear approaches to predict energy expenditure using accelerometer outputs from multiple sites and orientation can enhance accuracy., Conclusions: The development of portable accelerometers has made objective assessments of physical activity possible.

This paper describes the "manumeter," a device that logs total angular distance travelled by wrist and finger joints using a magnetic ring worn on the index finger and two triaxial magnetometers mounted in a watch-like unit. We describe an approach to estimate the wrist and finger joint angles using a radial basis function network that maps differential magnetometer readings to joint angles. We tested this approach by comparing manumeter estimates of total angular excursion with those from a passive goniometric exoskeleton worn simultaneously as seven participants completed a set of 12 manual tasks at low-, medium-, and high-intensity conditions on a first testing day, 1-2 days later, and 6-8 days later, using only the original calibration from the first testing day. Manumeter estimates scaled proportionally to the intensity of hand activity. Estimates of angular excursion made with the manumeter were 92.5{\%} ± 28.4 (SD), 98.3{\%} ± 23.3, and 94.7{\%} ± 19.3 of the goniometric exoskeleton across the three testing days, respectively.

abstract = {The study of finger kinematics has developed into an important research area. Various hand tracking systems are currently available; however, they all have limited functionality. Generally, the most commonly adopted sensors are limited to measurements with one degree of freedom, i.e., flexion/extension of fingers. More advanced measurements including finger abduction, adduction, and circumduction are much more difficult to achieve. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-axis 3D printed optical sensor with a compact configuration for tracking finger motion. Based on Malus' law, this sensor detects the angular changes by analyzing the attenuation of light transmitted through polarizing film. The sensor consists of two orthogonal axes each containing two pathways. The two readings from each axis are fused using a weighted average approach, enabling a measurement range up to 180     ∘     and an improvement in sensitivity. The sensor demonstrates high accuracy (±0.3     ∘    ), high repeatability, and low hysteresis error. Attaching the sensor to the index finger's metacarpophalangeal joint, real-time movements consisting of flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction have been successfully recorded. The proposed two-axis sensor has demonstrated its capability for measuring finger movements with two degrees of freedom and can be potentially used to monitor other types of body motion.},

abstract = {Introduction/Background Proximal arm non-use is when an individual with a weaker arm can use it, however spontaneously persists in under-using shoulder and elbow joints. The score of proximal arm non-use (PANU) is computed as the difference between the spontaneous use and the maximal use of shoulder and elbow joints. We previously quantified PANU using an ultrasound and marker-based movement analysis system (Zebris, CMS20s{\textregistered}). The aim of this study is to validate a low-cost markerless system (Microsoft Kinect{\textregistered}-based) against the reference system (CMS20s{\textregistered}) to determine PANU during seated reaching. Material and method In 19 hemiparetic stroke individuals the PANU score, reach length, trunk length, proximal arm use were measured during seated reaching simultaneously by the Kinect{\textregistered} (v2) and CMS20s{\textregistered} over two testing sessions separated by 2h. Results Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and linear regression analysis showed that the PANU score (ICC=0.95, r2=0.90), reach length (ICC=0.82, r2=0,70), trunk length (ICC=0.97, r2=0.94) and PAU (ICC=0.97, r2=0.93) measured using the Kinect were strongly related to those using the CMS20s. The PANU scores showed good test-retest reliability for both the Kinect (ICC=0.76) and CMS20s (ICC=0.72) with Bland {\&} Altman plots showing slightly reduced PANU scores (i.e., improved performance) in the re-test session for both systems (Kinect: −4,25±6.76; CMS20s: −4,71±7.88), which suggests a practice effect. Conclusion We conclude that the Kinect{\textregistered} can offer a low-cost and widely available solution to clinically assess PANU to monitor the progress of paretic arm recovery and to better individualise rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Angular measurements of knee joint are a key factor in orthoses design, actually is very important for human gait analysis in order to obtain a deep knowledge of the musculoskeletal system performance. Video-based motion analysis systems have been used as measurement tools to quantify the angle and movement of knee joint. Though this technique is good, it requires special equipment and high computational cost. This work introduces a novel method of knee joint measurement. The design is mainly based on the contactless magnetic absolute encoder AS5040 (Austria Microsystems{\textregistered}, USA), and the microprocessor type PIC16F877A. The developed device has a resolution of 0.35 degrees, quite enough for an orthosis that requires knee position measurements. The reliability of the system was evaluated by making: 1) Static measurements by using a mechanical goniometer as reference, in which a correlation up to 0.999 was obtained. 2) Dynamical measurements by performing flexion-extension movements by a healthy subject and comparing the records with a commercial motion analysis system (APAS{\textregistered}, USA). A correlation of 0.9943 was obtained. Besides, trials were performed by three subjects under natural gait.},

abstract = {We present the iRing, an intelligent input ring device developed for measuring finger gestures and external input. iRing recognizes rotation, finger bending, and external force via an infrared (IR) reflection sensor that leverages skin characteristics such as reflectance and softness. Furthermore, iRing allows using a push and stroke input method, which is popular in touch displays. The ring design has potential to be used as a wearable controller because its accessory shape is socially acceptable, easy to install, and safe, and iRing does not require extra devices. We present examples of iRing applications and discuss its validity as an inexpensive wearable interface and as a human sensing device.},

abstract = {Background: While the classification of multifunctional finger and wrist movement based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals in intact subjects can reach remarkable recognition rates, the performance obtained from amputated subjects remained low. Methods: In this paper, we proposed and evaluated the myoelectric control scheme of upper-limb prostheses by the continuous recognition of 17 multifunctional finger and wrist movements on 5 amputated subjects. Experimental validation was applied to select optimal features and classifiers for identifying sEMG and accelerometry (ACC) modalities under the windows-based analysis scheme. The majority vote is adopted to eliminate transient jumps and produces smooth output for window-based analysis scheme. Furthermore, principle component analysis was employed to reduce the dimension of features and to eliminate redundancy for ACC signal. Then a novel metric, namely movement error rate, was also employed to evaluate the performance of the continuous recognition framework proposed herein. Results: The average accuracy rates of classification were up to 88.7 ± 2.6{\%} over 5 amputated subjects, which was an outstanding result in comparison with the previous literature. Conclusion: The proposed technique was proven to be a potential candidate for intelligent prosthetic systems, which would increase quality of life for amputated subjects.},

In this paper, we describe the system at a high level and fo-cus on the dramatic performance improvements brought by deep learning. The paper is split according to the classic two-stage information retrieval dichotomy: first, we detail a deep candidate generation model and then describe a sepa-rate deep ranking model. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from designing, iterating and maintain-ing a massive recommendation system with enormous user-facing impact.},
