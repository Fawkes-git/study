abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In research on Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy, a structured interview, the Motor Activity Log (MAL), is used to assess how stroke survivors use their more-impaired arm outside the laboratory. This article examines the psychometrics of the 14-item version of this instrument in 2 chronic stroke samples with mild-to-moderate upper-extremity hemiparesis. METHODS: Participants (n=41) in the first study completed MALs before and after CI therapy or a placebo control procedure. In addition, caregivers independently completed a MAL on the participants. Participants (n=27) in the second study completed MALs and wore accelerometers that monitored their arm movements for 3 days outside the laboratory before and after an automated form of CI therapy. RESULTS: Validity of the participant MAL Quality of Movement (QOM) scale was supported. Correlations between pretreatment-to-posttreatment change scores on the participant QOM scale and caregiver MAL QOM scale, caregiver MAL amount of use (AOU) scale, and accelerometer recordings were 0.70, 0.73, and 0.91 (P{\textless}0.01), respectively. Internal consistency (alpha{\textgreater}0.81), test-retest reliability (r{\textgreater}0.91), stability, and responsiveness (ratio{\textgreater}3) of the participant QOM scale were also supported. The participant AOU and caregiver QOM and AOU scales were internally consistent, stable, and sensitive, but were not reliable. CONCLUSIONS: The participant MAL QOM scale can be used exclusively to reliably and validly measure real-world, upper-extremity rehabilitation outcome and functional status in chronic stroke patients with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Motor Activity Log (MAL) is a semistructured interview for hemiparetic stroke patients to assess the use of their paretic arm and hand (amount of use [AOU]) and quality of movement [QOM]) during activities of daily living. Scores range from 0 to 5. The following clinimetric properties of the MAL were quantified: internal consistency (Cronbach alpha), test-retest agreement (Bland and Altman method), cross-sectional construct validity (correlation between AOU and QOM and with the Action Research Arm [ARA] test), longitudinal construct validity (correlation of change on the MAL during the intervention with a global change rating [GCR] and with change on the ARA), and responsiveness (effect size). METHODS: Two baseline measurements 2 weeks apart and 1 follow-up measurement immediately after 2 weeks of intensive exercise therapy either with or without immobilization of the unimpaired arm (forced use) were performed in 56 chronic stroke patients. RESULTS: Internal consistency was high (AOU: alpha=0.88; QOM: alpha=0.91). The limits of agreement were -0.70 to 0.85 and -0.61 to 0.71 for AOU and QOM, respectively. The correlation with the ARA score (Spearman rho) was 0.63 (AOU and QOM). However, the improvement on the MAL during the intervention was only weakly related to the GCR and to the improvement on the ARA, Spearman rho was between 0.16 and 0.22. The responsiveness ratio was 1.9 (AOU) and 2.0 (QOM). CONCLUSIONS: The MAL is internally consistent and relatively stable in chronic stroke patients not undergoing an intervention. The cross-sectional construct validity of the MAL is reasonable, but the results raise doubt about its longitudinal construct validity.},

abstract = {Of various Human-Computer-Interactions (HCI), hand gesture based HCI might be the most natural and intuitive way to communicate between people and machines, since it closely mimics how human interact with each other. Its in- tuitiveness and naturalness have spawned many applications in exploring large and complex data, computer games, virtual reality, health care, etc. Although the market for hand gesture based HCI is huge, building a robust hand gesture recognition system remains a challenging problem for traditional vision-based approaches, which are greatly limited by the quality of the input from optical sensors. [16] proposed a novel dissimilarity distance metric for hand gesture recognition using Kinect sensor, called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD). In this paper, we compare the performance in terms of speed and accuracy between FEMD and traditional corresponding- based shape matching algorithm, Shape Context. And then we introduce several HCI applications built on top of a accurate and robust hand gesture recognition system based on FEMD. This hand gesture recognition system performs robustly despite variations in hand orientation, scale or articulation. Moreover, it works well in uncontrolled environments with background clus- ters. We demonstrate that this robust hand gesture recognition system can be a key enabler for numerous hand gesture based HCI systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ultimate goal of upper-limb rehabilitation after stroke is to promote real-world use, that is, use of the paretic upper-limb in everyday activities outside the clinic or laboratory. Although real-world use can be collected through self-report questionnaires, an objective indicator is preferred. Accelerometers are a promising tool. The current paper aims to explore the feasibility of accelerometers to measure upper-limb use after stroke and discuss the translation of this measurement tool into clinical practice. Accelerometers are non-invasive, wearable sensors that measure movement in arbitrary units called activity counts. Research to date indicates that activity counts are a reliable and valid index of upper-limb use. While most accelerometers are unable to distinguish between the type and quality of movements performed, recent advancements have used accelerometry data to produce clinically meaningful information for clinicians, patients, family and care givers. Despite this, widespread uptake in research and clinical environments remains limited. If uptake was enhanced, we could build a deeper understanding of how people with stroke use their arm in real-world environments. In order to facilitate greater uptake, however, there is a need for greater consistency in protocol development, accelerometer application and data interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We present LightRing, a wearable sensor in a ring form factor that senses the 2d location of a fingertip on any surface, independent of orientation or material. The device consists of an infrared proximity sensor for measuring finger flexion and a 1-axis gyroscope for measuring finger rotation. Notably, LightRing tracks subtle fingertip movements from the finger base without requiring instrumentation of other body parts or the environment. This keeps the normal hand function intact and allows for a socially acceptable appearance. We evaluate LightRing in a 2d pointing experiment in two scenarios: on a desk while sitting down, and on the leg while standing. Our results indicate that the device has potential to enable a variety of rich mobile input scenarios. Author},

@article{Taub2006,
abstract = {Research on monkeys with a single forelimb from which sensation is surgically abolished demonstrates that such animals do not use their deafferented limb even though they possess sufficient motor innervation to do so, a phenomenon labeled learned nonuse. This dissociation also occurs after neurological injury in humans. Instruments that measure these two aspects of motor function are discussed. The effects of a neurological injury may differ widely in regard to motor ability assessed on a laboratory performance test in which movements are requested and actual spontaneous use of an extremity in real-world settings, indicating that these parameters need to be evaluated separately. The methods used in Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CI therapy) research to independently assess these two domains are reliable and valid. We suggest that these tests have applicability beyond studies involving CI therapy for stroke and may be of value for determining motor status in other types of motor disorders and with other types of treatment. The learned nonuse formulation also predicts that a rehabilitation treatment may have differential effects on motor performance made on request and actual spontaneous amount of use of a more affected upper extremity in the life situation. CI therapy produces improvements in the former, but focuses attention on the latter and, in fact, spontaneous use of the limb is where this intervention has by far its greatest effect. The evidence suggests that this result is driven by use of a ''transfer package'' of techniques, which can be used with other therapies to increase the transfer of improvements made in the clinic to the life situation. The use of CI therapy in humans began with the upper extremity after stroke and was then extended for the upper extremity to cerebral palsy in young children (8 months to 8 years old) and traumatic brain injury. A form of CI therapy was developed for the lower extremities and was used effectively after stroke, spinal cord injury, and fractured hip. Adaptations of CI therapy have also been developed for aphasia (CI aphasia therapy), focal hand dystonia in musicians and phantom limb pain. The range of these applications suggests that CI therapy is not only a treatment for stroke, for which it is most commonly used, but for learned nonuse in general, which manifests as excess motor disability in a number of conditions which until now have been refractory to treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The consensus is that the most important outcome for rehabilitation is functional activity in the life situation. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy, a new treatment that transfers in-clinic gains to the life situation, demands objective measurement of real-world movement. However, direct, objective, and accurate measures of arm use in the real world are not available. Previous attempts to use accelerometry to measure extremity movement have failed because of unacceptable variability. This problem has been addressed here by use of a threshold filter. METHODS: Nine stroke patients and 1 healthy individual wearing accelerometers were videotaped while they carried out their usual activities at home or in the clinic; the duration of their arm, torso, and ambulatory movements was judged by 2 observation teams. In addition, 11 college students performed 5 standardized activities of daily living for varying durations in the laboratory. The accelerometer data were transformed; the raw value recorded for a given epoch was set to a constant if it exceeded a low threshold. RESULTS: The threshold-filtered recordings measured the duration of movement accurately and with very little variability. Correlations between the threshold-filtered recordings and the observer ratings of the duration of arm, torso, and ambulatory movements were 0.93, 0.93 and 0.99, respectively; the corresponding correlations for the raw values were -0.17, 0.34, and 0.85. CONCLUSIONS: These results present initial evidence for the validity of threshold-filtered accelerometer recordings for objectively measuring the amount of real-world upper-extremity movement as an index of treatment outcome for rehabilitation patients.},

abstract = {The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive approach for assessing the upper extremity (UE) after stroke. First, common UE impairments and how to assess them are briefly discussed. Although multiple UE impairments are typically present after stroke, the severity of one's impairment, paresis, is the primary determinant of UE functional loss. Second, UE function is operationally defined and a number of clinical measures are discussed. It is important to consider how impairment and loss of function affect UE activity outside of the clinical environment. Thus, this review also identifies accelerometry as an objective method for assessing UE activity in daily life. Finally, the role that each of these levels of assessment should play in clinical decision making is discussed to optimize the provision of stroke rehabilitation services. ?? 2013 Hanley {\&} Belfus, an imprint of Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A key reason for referral to rehabilitation services after stroke and other neurological conditions is to improve one's ability to function in daily life. It has become important to measure a person's activities in daily life, and not just measure their capacity for activity in the structured environment of a clinic or laboratory. A wearable sensor that is now enabling measurement of daily movement is the accelerometer. Accelerometers are commercially-available devices resembling large wrist watches that can be worn throughout the day. Data from accelerometers can quantify how the limbs are engaged to perform activities in peoples' homes and communities. This report describes a methodology to collect accelerometry data and turn it into clinically-relevant information. First, data are collected by having the participant wear two accelerometers (one on each wrist) for 24 h or longer. The accelerometry data are then downloaded and processed to produce four different variables that describe key aspects of upper limb activity in daily life: hours of use, use ratio, magnitude ratio, and the bilateral magnitude. Density plots can be constructed that visually represent the data from the 24 h wearing period. The variables and their resultant density plots are highly consistent in neurologically-intact, community-dwelling adults. This striking consistency makes them a useful tool for determining if upper limb daily performance is different from normal. This methodology is appropriate for research studies investigating upper limb dysfunction and interventions designed to improve upper limb performance in daily life in people with stroke and other patient populations. Because of its relative simplicity, it may not be long before it is also incorporated in clinical neurorehabilitation practice.},

Improved function in the paretic arm is also a major goal of rehabilitation, but there are few good measures of daily arm use. Accelerometers are devices that measure body movements in terms of acceleration. Accelerometers have been found to be useful indicators of movement in a number of studies involving different patient populations. They are able to detect habitual physical activity levels in subjects with low levels or activity and altered gait patterns. Different systems of multiple accelerometers have been used successfully to detect arm usage in individuals with hemiparesis from stroke, as well as with other disabilities that affect the upper extremities.},

The scales are printed on separate sheets of paper and are placed in front of the participant during test administration. participants should be told that they can give half scores (i.e., 0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5) if this is reflective of their ratings. 2. Rating Scales Both the AS and HW scales are used during all test administrations, except for the periodic administration(s) of the MAL during treatment, when only the HW scale is used. In all administrations except those done during treatment, begin with the AS scale and ask participants to rate all tasks using the AS scale first. (See Comment 1 at the end of the manual) The tester then describes to the participant the difference between the AS and HW scales (as suggested in the instructions) and the UE MAL HW Rating Video is shown. The participant then rates all tasks performed with the HW scale. The UE MAL Demonstration Video is not shown at the screening administration (first administration) or for administrations during treatment, but it is shown again during post-treatment administration. (See Comment 5c) The tester should not ask the participant to rate the more-affected UE on the HW scale if they have already rated the more-affected UE as a 0 for the AS.},

abstract = {Objective: To develop and evaluate a system for the objective measurement of upper-limb activity during a person's activities of daily living. Design: Construct validation study. Setting: Home and work environment. Participants: Ten able-bodied participants and 10 stroke patients. Interventions: A novel activity monitor was developed for monitoring upper-limb activity. The Strathclyde Upper-Limb Activity Monitor (SULAM) gave a signal proportional to the vertical displacement of the wrist with respect to the shoulder. Participants wore the SULAM on both upper limbs for 8 hours while performing their normal daily activities. Main Outcome Measures: SULAM-derived variables quantified the total upper-limb activity and the range in which movement of the upper limb occurred. Results: Data showed that the dominant arm of the able-bodied participants was 19{\%} more active than the nondominant arm, whereas the unaffected arms of the group of stroke patients was used 3 to 6 times more than their affected arm. For all the variables, in both groups, there were significant differences between their upper limbs except for movement below midtrunk. There were also significant differences between groups for bimanual movement time (P=.000) and composite movement time (P=.000). Conclusions: The results suggest that the quantification of vertical position of the wrist with respect to the shoulder might reflect upper-limb activity. By using the SULAM, it is possible to monitor upper-limb activity over the course of a person's normal day, with minimal interference. This study provides preliminary evidence of the SULAM as a useful tool for objectively evaluating interventions aimed at improving upper-limb activity and function. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

Our prototype, BackHand, uses an array of strain gauge sensors affixed to the back of hands, and applies machine learning techniques to recognize a variety of hand gestures. We conducted a user study with 10 participants to better understand gesture recognition accuracy and the effects of sensing locations. Results showed that sensor reading patterns differ significantly across users, but are consistent for the same user. The leave-one-user-out accuracy is low at an average of 27.4{\%}, but reaches 95.8{\%} average accuracy for 16 popular hand gestures when personalized for each participant.

abstract = {Background: While the classification of multifunctional finger and wrist movement based on surface electromyography (sEMG) signals in intact subjects can reach remarkable recognition rates, the performance obtained from amputated subjects remained low. Methods: In this paper, we proposed and evaluated the myoelectric control scheme of upper-limb prostheses by the continuous recognition of 17 multifunctional finger and wrist movements on 5 amputated subjects. Experimental validation was applied to select optimal features and classifiers for identifying sEMG and accelerometry (ACC) modalities under the windows-based analysis scheme. The majority vote is adopted to eliminate transient jumps and produces smooth output for window-based analysis scheme. Furthermore, principle component analysis was employed to reduce the dimension of features and to eliminate redundancy for ACC signal. Then a novel metric, namely movement error rate, was also employed to evaluate the performance of the continuous recognition framework proposed herein. Results: The average accuracy rates of classification were up to 88.7 ± 2.6{\%} over 5 amputated subjects, which was an outstanding result in comparison with the previous literature. Conclusion: The proposed technique was proven to be a potential candidate for intelligent prosthetic systems, which would increase quality of life for amputated subjects.},

The system consists of four modules: a real time hand tracking and extraction, feature extraction, hidden Markov model (HMM) training, and gesture recognition. First, we apply a real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm to trace the moving hand and extract the hand region, then we use the Fourier descriptor (FD) to characterize spatial features and the motion analysis to characterize the temporal features. We combine the spatial and temporal features of the input image sequence as our feature vector. After having extracted the feature vectors, we apply HMMs to recognize the input gesture. The gesture to be recognized is separately scored against different HMMs. The model with the highest score indicates the corresponding gesture. In the experiments, we have tested our system to recognize 20 different gestures, and the recognizing rate is above 90{\%}.},

abstract = {Objective: To quantify uni- and bimanual upper-limb use in patients with chronic stroke in daily life compared with healthy controls. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: Outpatient rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients with chronic stroke (n=38) and healthy controls (n=18). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Upper-limb use in daily life was measured with an accelerometry-based upper-limb activity monitor, an accelerometer based measurement device. Unimanual use of the paretic and the nonparetic side and bimanual upper-limb use were measured for a period of 24 hours. Outcomes were expressed in terms of both duration and intensity. Results: Patients used their unaffected limb much more than their affected limb (5.3h vs 2.4h), while controls used both limbs a more equal amount of time (5.4h vs 5.1h). Patients used their paretic side less than controls used their nondominant side and their nonparetic side more than controls their dominant side. The intensity with which patients used their paretic side was lower than that with which controls used their nondominant side, while that of the nonparetic side was higher than that of the dominant side of controls. Finally, patients used their paretic side almost exclusively in bimanual activities. During bimanual activities, the intensity with which they used their affected side was much lower than that of the nonaffected side. Conclusion: Our data show considerable nonuse of the paretic side, both in duration and in intensity, and both during unimanual and bimanual activities in patients with chronic stroke. Patients do compensate for this with increased use of the nonparetic side. ?? 2012 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The ultimate goal of upper-limb rehabilitation after stroke is to promote real-world use, that is, use of the paretic upper-limb in everyday activities outside the clinic or laboratory. Although real-world use can be collected through self-report questionnaires, an objective indicator is preferred. Accelerometers are a promising tool. The current paper aims to explore the feasibility of accelerometers to measure upper-limb use after stroke and discuss the translation of this measurement tool into clinical practice. Accelerometers are non-invasive, wearable sensors that measure movement in arbitrary units called activity counts. Research to date indicates that activity counts are a reliable and valid index of upper-limb use. While most accelerometers are unable to distinguish between the type and quality of movements performed, recent advancements have used accelerometry data to produce clinically meaningful information for clinicians, patients, family and care givers. Despite this, widespread uptake in research and clinical environments remains limited. If uptake was enhanced, we could build a deeper understanding of how people with stroke use their arm in real-world environments. In order to facilitate greater uptake, however, there is a need for greater consistency in protocol development, accelerometer application and data interpretation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The paper also compares these properties in several commonly used single-site accelerometers. The emerging accelerometry technologies introduced include the multisensor arrays and the combination of accelerometers with physiological sensors. The outputs of accelerometers are compared with criterion measures of energy expenditure (indirect calorimeters and double-labeled water) to develop mathematical models (linear, nonlinear, and variability approaches)., Results: The technologies of the sensor and data processing directly influence the results of the outcome measurement (activity counts and energy expenditure predictions). Multisite assessment and combining accelerometers with physiological measures may offer additional advantages. Nonlinear approaches to predict energy expenditure using accelerometer outputs from multiple sites and orientation can enhance accuracy., Conclusions: The development of portable accelerometers has made objective assessments of physical activity possible. Future technological improvements will include examining raw acceleration signals and developing advanced models for accurate energy expenditure predictions., (C)2005The American College of Sports Medicine},

abstract = {Objective: To study the validity of accelerometry in the assessment of arm activity of patients with impaired arm function after stroke. Design: Cross-sectional concurrent validity study. Setting: Rehabilitation center. Participants: Patients (N=45) at different stages after stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: All patients wore 2 triaxial accelerometers around their wrists during 3 consecutive days. Arm activity was assessed, based on unilateral (activity of the affected arm) and bilateral accelerometry (ratio between the activity of the affected and nonaffected arm). The Motor Activity Log-26 (MAL-26) Amount of Use (AOU) scale was used as the main external criterion to test the concurrent validity of arm accelerometry. In addition, the MAL-26 Quality of Movement (QOM) scale and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) subscale Hand Function were used. To test the divergent validity, the SIS subscale Mobility was used. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated. In an additional regression analysis, the hypothesized confounding influence of spasm, therapy intensity, and interobserver differences was studied. Results: Both unilateral (??=.58, P{\textless}.001) and bilateral (??=.60, P{\textless}.001) accelerometry were significantly related to the MAL-AOU scale. Associations of both unilateral and bilateral accelerometry with the MAL-QOM and SIS subscale Hand Function corroborated these findings. The SIS subscale Mobility was not significantly associated with unilateral accelerometry (??=.41, P=.01) or bilateral accelerometry (??=.23, P=.11). None of the hypothesized confounders influenced these associations significantly. Conclusions: Based on the results, both the concurrent and divergent validity of unilateral and bilateral arm accelerometry for measuring arm activity after stroke are good. ?? 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract = {Stroke is a disease that currently attracts more attention in Indonesia according to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. This research was motivated by the shortage of physiotherapists which can not catch the increasing number of stroke patients. The therapy becomes less effective and less efficient since each therapist must handle too many patients during his/her work hours. This research has developed a device prototype that can help the therapy to measure and monitor patient exercise, especially at the final stage of rehabilitation when the patient gets therapy to move actively. The angle of the moving body parts  that can represent the ability of patient motion was measured using accelerometers. The developed prototype was in the form of a glove, equipped with an Arduino Nano and two accelerometer modules, that measures the motion of the thumb and index finger. The device was calibrated and tested to determine the characteristics of the sensors. This test showed that the gloves prototype had an accuracy of 95,8{\%} and precision of 99,6{\%}. The application of the prototype was carried out on four types of finger movements, namely thumb abduction-adduction, thumb flexion-extension, finger flexion-hyperextension, and finger abduction-adduction. The prototype was also tested for its ability to work in variations of direction and position of the hand.},

abstract = {Nonobtrusive options for monitoring the wrist and hand movement are needed for stroke rehabilitation and other applications. This paper describes the "manumeter," a device that logs total angular distance travelled by wrist and finger joints using a magnetic ring worn on the index finger and two triaxial magnetometers mounted in a watch-like unit. We describe an approach to estimate the wrist and finger joint angles using a radial basis function network that maps differential magnetometer readings to joint angles. We tested this approach by comparing manumeter estimates of total angular excursion with those from a passive goniometric exoskeleton worn simultaneously as seven participants completed a set of 12 manual tasks at low-, medium-, and high-intensity conditions on a first testing day, 1-2 days later, and 6-8 days later, using only the original calibration from the first testing day. Manumeter estimates scaled proportionally to the intensity of hand activity. Estimates of angular excursion made with the manumeter were 92.5{\%} ± 28.4 (SD), 98.3{\%} ± 23.3, and 94.7{\%} ± 19.3 of the goniometric exoskeleton across the three testing days, respectively. Magnetic sensing of wrist and finger movement is nonobtrusive and can quantify the amount of use of the hand across days.},

abstract = {Iris recognition is one of a popular Biometrics technique for identifying people. Normally, iris color and texture have been created since the first three months and they will be completed within one year. Iris will then remain unchanged until the end of one's life. Both sides of the iris eyes are different. Moreover, the iris is unique and independent for genealogy even though in twins. Iris recognition has several sequence steps, pre-processing, features extractions, post-processing, and matching. In this paper, a box-counting fractal dimension and low-high pass filters have been used to extract iris features. This method can speed up a process by reducing a number of features. The experimental results show 91.22{\%} matching accuracy with approximately 2.76 seconds for each matching.},

abstract = {This article describes the study design, methodological considerations, and demographic characteristics of a phase III RCT to determine if 1) constraint-induced therapy (CI therapy) can be applied with therapeutic success 3 to 9 months after stroke across different sites, 2) gains that might occur persist over 2 years, 3) initial level of motor ability determines responsiveness to CI therapy, and 4) the treatment effect differs between those treated before 9 months and after 1 year. Six sites will screen and recruit poststroke survivors stratified on initial level of motor ability and after randomization allocate participants to immediate or delayed intervention. Primary outcomes include a laboratory-based measure of function (Wolf Motor Function Test [WMFT]) and a real-world participant-centered functional use measure (Motor Activity Log [MAI]). Secondary outcomes concern function, behavior, and compliance. This is the first multisite, single-blind RCT of a formal training intervention for upper extremity rehabilitation in subacute stroke in the United States.},
